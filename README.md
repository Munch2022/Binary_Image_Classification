# Binary_Image_Classification
Simple CNN net is used to Classify the image of dogs and cats from the dataset 

# Description: 

•	Created a tool that can predict and classify if the given image is dog or a cat

•	Dataset is obtained from Kaggle

• preprocessed image data to feed into the neural nets 

•	Implemented CNN model for this classfication problem

• Image operations are performed using Python Libraries like OpenCV, keras, TensorFlow, numpy etc..
